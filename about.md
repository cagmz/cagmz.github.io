I'm a senior at CSU Channel Islands majoring in Computer Science. I love all things open source, especially the Python ecosystem.

My main interests include sustainable agriculture and machine learning, and I'm interested of ways to combine both.

See my latest resume [here]( {{ "assets/docs/Carlos_Adrian_Gomez_Resume.pdf" | absolute_url }} ).
